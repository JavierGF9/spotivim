NOTE: This plug-in only works on Linux

SpotiVim is a plug-in for Vim that provides simple Spotify integration
using D-Bus. Right now, it uses the command [dbus-send](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-send.1.html),
so the capabilities of the plug-in are limited by it.

Currently, the following functionality is provided:
- Skip to previous and next song
- Toggle play/pause
- Get artist and title information of the current song

The plug-in is still in development. Becouse of that, there will be more
features in the future.
